# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Pewlett-Hackard Analysis Overview

In this project, our overall objective was to use our analysis to solve a variety of questions. Primarily, we focused on determining how many employees were retiring per title and those who qualified to be a part of the mentorship eligibility program depending on their seniority, which determined eligibility.

## Results

When it came to amount of employees that were ready to retire, the majority were: 

* Senior Engineers and Senior Staff

In comparison to the rest of the positions that were ready to retire, based on our analysis, we were able to infer that:

* A small amount of retiring titles are in the management position titles.

* There was also no employees in the Manager position that were eligible for the mentorship program.

Based on our analysis, it was easy to note with our results that there is a disporportion between the distribution of job titles and employees.

## Summary
